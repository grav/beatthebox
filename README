WHAT IS IT?
BeatTheBox is going to be a game ... at some point. 

Currently, it's just some library code, ported from Java. The library code will eventually be able to recognize different types of human beatboxing drumsounds. Take a look at http://cs.au.dk/~grav/thesis for more information. 

Be aware that the code currently has a lot of memory leaks, since it used to hang around a friendly garbage collector on the JVM.

LIBRARY DEPENDENCIES
The code currently depends on the FFTW3 library (just the c-version).The pattern matching will eventually depend on a Matrix-library, either Armadillo (which seems to have some problems with LLVM/Clang) or Blitz.

The tests run via the Google C++ test framework. Some util-methods and tests also depend on libsndfile (c++ bindings).
