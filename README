WHAT IS IT?
BeatTheBox is going to be a game ... at some point. 

Currently, it's just some library code, ported from Java. The library code is able to train a linear model and recognize different types of human beatboxing drum sounds. Take a look at http://cs.au.dk/~grav/thesis for more information. 

LIBRARY DEPENDENCIES
The code currently depends on the FFTW3 library (just the c-version).

The tests run via the Google C++ test framework. Some util-methods and tests also depend on libsndfile (c++ bindings).
