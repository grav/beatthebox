BeatTheBox is going to be a game ... at some point. 

Currently, it's just some library code, ported from Java. The library code will eventually be able to recognize different types of human beatboxing drumsounds. Take a look at http://cs.au.dk/~grav/thesis for more information. 

Be aware that the port has a lot of memory leaks, since it used to hang around a friendly garbage collector on the JVM.
